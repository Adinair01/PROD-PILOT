# PROD PILOT
## Pre-Development Decision Intelligence Platform for Product Teams

PROD PILOT is a scalable backend-driven system designed to help product teams evaluate feature feasibility, identify risks, and surface system dependencies **before engineering commitment.**

Modern teams often rely on meetings, fragmented discussions, and tribal knowledge when making product decisions. PROD PILOT introduces a structured intelligence layer that reduces ambiguity and enables faster, data-informed decision-making.

##  Core Vision
Shift product teams from **discussion-driven decisions → intelligence-driven decisions.**

## ⭐ Primary Features

### 1️ Multi-Interface Collaboration Layer *(Currently Under Development)*

PROD PILOT provides dedicated interfaces for key engineering stakeholders:

- Frontend Engineers  
- Backend Engineers  
- QA Teams  
- Data Engineers  
- Product Managers  

Each interface captures structured feedback on proposed features, enabling cross-functional visibility into risks, dependencies, and technical constraints early in the lifecycle.

**Goal:** Eliminate siloed communication and surface engineering insights before development begins.

---

### 2️ PM Decision Insight Engine *(Planned Feature)*

The upcoming Insight Engine will analyze stakeholder inputs to generate a **decision report** that includes:

✅ Feasibility assessment  
✅ Risk indicators  
✅ Potential engineering blockers  
✅ Impacted systems  
✅ Stakeholders to involve  
✅ Edge case signals  

**Objective:** Help Product Managers make confident, high-quality decisions without relying solely on intuition.

## Why PROD PILOT?

Pre-development uncertainty is one of the largest sources of:

- delayed releases  
- scope creep  
- engineering rework  
- stakeholder misalignment  

PROD PILOT acts as a decision intelligence layer positioned **before tools like Jira**, improving clarity before execution starts.
